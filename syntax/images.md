# Images

```markdown
# Inline
![Alternative text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

# Reference
![Alternative text][id]
[id]: url/to/image  "Optional title"
```
If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. The syntax is nearly the same.

The difference is that an image is prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ), followed by the same two brackets, and a pair of parentheses containing the image URL. Within the image brackets, you can place some "alt text," which is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.

Here's a quiz about markdown images.

Select the valid images:
- [ ] `[Google logo](https://www.google.ru/logo.png)`
- [x] `![](https://www.google.ru/logo.png)`

> Images must be prefixed with an exclamation mark.
The alternative text and a title are optional.

What is true about the following line: ```![Funny cat](http://cats.ru/funny.png "Share this")```
- [x] if the url is 404, "Funny cat" will be displayed
- [ ] exclamation mark can be omitted in this case
- [ ] if the url is 404, "Share this" will be displayed
- [x] on mouse over the image "Share this" will be displayed

> Similarly to links, images can have 3 parts: the alternative text, the url and a title. An exclamation mark is nesessary.
